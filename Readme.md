Here's a detailed example of how you can structure your README file for this assignment. This will cover both the local implementation and the deployment process, including how you hosted your application on Web01 and Web02 servers, and how your load balancer works.

## Project Overview

This application is a web-based service that allows users to interact with real-time data fetched from an external API. The application serves a meaningful purpose by helping users with [describe the real-world problem it addresses, such as weather forecasting, news aggregation, or financial data]. This project demonstrates the integration of an external API, user interaction via a simple interface, and scalability through a load-balanced architecture.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **External API**: [API you used (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, NewsAPI, etc.)]
- **Web Servers**: Apache/Nginx (for serving the application)
- **Load Balancer**: HAProxy
- **Other Tools**: Git, SSH, etc.

---

## API Integration

For this project, I used the [API name] to fetch real-time data that is displayed on the frontend. The API offers endpoints for fetching [specific data your app pulls, e.g., weather data, stock prices, etc.]. 

- **API Documentation**: [Link to the API documentation]
- **API Key**: The API key is stored securely in environment variables and is never exposed in the repository.

Example of API usage:
```javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/data?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    // Process the data
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
  });
```

---

## Application Features

- **Real-time Data**: Fetches and displays data from the external API.
- **User Interaction**: Allows users to filter, search, and sort data according to their needs.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API errors and downtime, showing appropriate messages to the user.
- **Responsiveness**: The application is responsive and works on various devices.

## Local Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to run the application locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14.x or higher)
- Git
- An API key for the external API (store this securely)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
   cd your-repository-name
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your API key:
   ```
   API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. Start the local server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open the application in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

---

## Deployment Instructions

### Deploying on Web Servers (Web01 and Web02)

1. SSH into your servers (`Web01` and `Web02`):
   ```bash
   ssh user@web01_ip
   ```

2. Clone the repository on each server:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
   cd your-repository-name
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Configure Apache or Nginx to serve the application:
   - For Nginx, modify the configuration to point to port `3000`.
   - Example Nginx config:
     ```
     server {
         listen 80;
         server_name web01.example.com;
         location / {
             proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
         }
     }
     ```

6. Repeat the steps on `Web02`.

### Configuring the Load Balancer (Lb01)

1. SSH into your load balancer:
   ```bash
   ssh user@lb01_ip
   ```

2. Install HAProxy:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install haproxy
   ```

3. Edit the HAProxy configuration file (`/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`):
   ```haproxy
   frontend http_front
       bind *:80
       default_backend web_servers

   backend web_servers
       balance roundrobin
       server web01 web01_ip:80 check
       server web02 web02_ip:80 check
   ```

4. Restart HAProxy:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart haproxy
   ```

## Accessing the Application

After deploying the application to `Web01`, `Web02`, and configuring the load balancer (`Lb01`), you can access the application at the following URLs:

- **Load Balancer**: [http://54.90.179.62:3000](http://54.90.179.62:3000)
- **Web01**: [http://54.90.179.62:3000](http://54.90.179.62:3000)
- **Web02**: [http://18.214.99.45:3000](http://18.214.99.45:3000)

Both `Web01` and `Web02` should handle traffic, but requests are distributed by the load balancer, ensuring high availability.

---

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Challenge 1**: API rate limits and handling downtime.
  - **Solution**: Implemented error handling and retries using JavaScript's `try/catch` blocks to manage API downtime.
  
- **Challenge 2**: Configuring the load balancer correctly.
  - **Solution**: Used the `roundrobin` method for load balancing, ensuring that requests are evenly distributed between `Web01` and `Web02`. I also verified the backend servers' health checks.
